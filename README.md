# TriviaGame

I started off by making objects for all the questions, consisting of the question, the multiple choices, and the correct answer.

I then made global variables for the scoreboard, the timer, and the user guesses.

The first function starts the game, and triggers the displayQ function, which displays the question, and all of the choices, and appends 4 buttons.

After 5 questions, the game ends, and the scoreboard is shown.
